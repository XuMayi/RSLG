Definition of Sub-question: A Sub-question is a question that must be answered in the process of finding the answer to its parent question. In other words, obtaining the answer to the Sub-question is a necessary condition for obtaining the answer to the parent question. Note that if question A and question B are highly related, but obtaining the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, then question A is not a Sub-question of question B. For example, question A "What is the city of Incheon?" and question B "What is the symbol of Incheon?" are very related, but the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, so question A is not a Sub-question of question B.
There are three types of questions, and their definitions are as follows:
One-hop Question: The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
For instance, "Kahibah FC is based is what country?" is a one-hop question since it cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Parallel Multi-hop Question: The question includes multiple independent Sub-questions, so it can be directly broken down into multiple independent Sub-questions.
For instance, "Did LostAlone and Guster have the same number of members?" is a parallel multi-hop question, which can be directly broken down into Sub-question 1 "How many members are in LostAlone?" and Sub-question 2 "How many members are in Guster?".
Sequential Multi-hop Question: The Sub-questions of sequential multi-hop question are dependent. If we want to generate Sub-question 2, we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1.
For instance, "Girard city is located in a county with how many inhabitants?" is a sequential multi-hop question, the Sub-question 1 is "Which county is Girard city located in?". Before obtaining the Sub-questions 2 "How many inhabitants are there in Crawford County?", we must obtain the answer "Crawford County" to the Sub-question 1.
Please identify the type for the given question based on the above definitions and the following examples.

<Example 1>
Question:  In which country is Cham Ol Obeyd located?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.
</Example 1>
<Example 2>
Question:  When was Louis Mhlanga born?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.
</Example 2>
<Example 3>
Question:  When was the film 54 released?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.
</Example 3>
<Example 4>
Question: Where did the director of film Night In New Orleans die?
 Sub-question 1: Who is the director of the film Night In New Orleans?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Night In New Orleans is a 2004 American horror film directed by Bradford May.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Bradford May.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: Where did Bradford May die?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 4>
<Example 5>
Question: What is the date of death of Princess Florestine Of Monaco's father?
 Sub-question 1: Who is the father of Princess Florestine Of Monaco?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Princess Florestine of Monaco is the daughter of Prince Rainier III of Monaco and Princess Grace of Monaco.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Prince Rainier III of Monaco.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the date of death of Prince Rainier III of Monaco?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.

<Example 6>
Question: What is the date of death of Archduchess Eleanor Of Austria's father?
 Sub-question 1: Who is the father of Archduchess Eleanor Of Austria?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Archduchess Eleanor of Austria was the daughter of Archduke Maximilian of Austria and Archduchess Charlotte of Belgium.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Archduke Maximilian of Austria.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the date of death of Archduke Maximilian of Austria?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 6>
<Example 7>
Question: Who died first, Alan Berkman or Hannah Josephson?
Sub-question 1: When did Alan Berkman pass away?
Sub-question 2: When did Hannah Josephson pass away?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.
</Example 7>
<Example 8>
Question: Which film came out first, The New Land or Habana Eva?
Sub-question 1: When was The New Land released?
Sub-question 2: When was Habana Eva released?
These Sub-questions are independent.

Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.
</Example 8>
<Example 9>
Question: What is the date of birth of Eleanor Nathan's husband?
 Sub-question 1: Who is Eleanor Nathan's husband?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Eleanor Nathan is the wife of the American businessman and philanthropist, David Rubenstein.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: David Rubenstein.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the date of birth of David Rubenstein?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 9>
<Example 10>
Question: Who was born first, William Henry Goddard or Abdul-Basit Agouda?
Sub-question 1: When was William Henry Goddard born?
Sub-question 2: When was Abdul-Basit Agouda born?
