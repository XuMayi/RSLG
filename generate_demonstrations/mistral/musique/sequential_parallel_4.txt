Definition of Sub-question: A Sub-question is a question that must be answered in the process of finding the answer to its parent question. In other words, obtaining the answer to the Sub-question is a necessary condition for obtaining the answer to the parent question. Note that if question A and question B are highly related, but obtaining the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, then question A is not a Sub-question of question B. For example, question A "What is the city of Incheon?" and question B "What is the symbol of Incheon?" are very related, but the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, so question A is not a Sub-question of question B.
There are three types of questions, and their definitions are as follows:
One-hop Question: The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
For instance, "Kahibah FC is based is what country?" is a one-hop question since it cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Parallel Multi-hop Question: The question includes multiple independent Sub-questions, so it can be directly broken down into multiple independent Sub-questions.
For instance, "Did LostAlone and Guster have the same number of members?" is a parallel multi-hop question, which can be directly broken down into Sub-question 1 "How many members are in LostAlone?" and Sub-question 2 "How many members are in Guster?".
Sequential Multi-hop Question: The Sub-questions of sequential multi-hop question are dependent. If we want to generate Sub-question 2, we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1.
For instance, "Girard city is located in a county with how many inhabitants?" is a sequential multi-hop question, the Sub-question 1 is "Which county is Girard city located in?". Before obtaining the Sub-questions 2 "How many inhabitants are there in Crawford County?", we must obtain the answer "Crawford County" to the Sub-question 1.
Please identify the type for the given question based on the above definitions and the following examples.

<Example 1>
Question: What year marked the foundation of the school where Garnet Baltimore was educated?
 Sub-question 1: Which school was Garnet Baltimore educated in?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Garnet Baltimore is a fictional character from the American television series "The Wire". He is a student at the Baltimore City College, a public high school in Baltimore, Maryland.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Baltimore City College.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What year was Baltimore City College founded?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 1>
<Example 2>
Question: Who was the president of the body that petitioned the king of England to recognize the rights of colonists when the declaration of independence was adopted?
Sub-question 1: Who was the president of the Continental Congress when the Declaration of Independence was adopted?
Sub-question 2: Which body petitioned the king of England to recognize the rights of colonists?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.

<Example 3>
Question: What was the record label of the singer of Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood?
Sub-question 1: Who is the singer of Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood?
Sub-question 2: What is the record label of the identified singer?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.

<Example 4>
Question: What is the population of the city where the Museum of Vietnamese History is located?
 Sub-question 1: Which city is the Museum of Vietnamese History located in?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: The Museum of Vietnamese History is located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Ho Chi Minh City.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the population of Ho Chi Minh City?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 4>
<Example 5>
Question: What is the map location of the river where Sixmile Island is found?
 Sub-question 1: Which river is Sixmile Island found on?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Sixmile Island is an island in the St. Lawrence River, located in the Thousand Islands region of New York, United States.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: St. Lawrence River.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the map location of the St. Lawrence River?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 5>
<Example 6>
Question: What is the average income in the county where San Antonio located?
 Sub-question 1: Which county is San Antonio located in?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: San Antonio is a city in Texas, United States, and it is the county seat of Bexar County.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Bexar County.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the average income in Bexar County?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.

<Example 7>
Question:  What is the capital of Collier County?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.

Question: How many lives were lost in the bombing of Nagasaki and the birthplace of Marii Hasegawa?
Sub-question 1: How many lives were lost in the bombing of Nagasaki?
Sub-question 2: Where was Marii Hasegawa born?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.

Parallel Multi-hop Question: The question includes multiple independent Sub-questions, so it can be directly broken down into multiple independent Sub-questions.
For instance, "Did LostAlone and Guster have the same number of members?" is a parallel multi-hop question, which can be directly broken down into Sub-question 1 "How many members are in LostAlone?" and Sub-question 2 "How many members are in Guster?".
Sequential Multi-hop Question: The Sub-questions of sequential multi-hop question are dependent. If we want to generate Sub-question 2, we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1.
For instance, "Girard city is located in a county with how many inhabitants?" is a sequential multi-hop question, the Sub-question 1 is "Which county is Girard city located in?". Before obtaining the Sub-questions 2 "How many inhabitants are there in Crawford County?", we must obtain the answer "Crawford County" to the Sub-question 1.
