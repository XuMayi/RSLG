Definition of Sub-question: A Sub-question is a question that must be answered in the process of finding the answer to its parent question. In other words, obtaining the answer to the Sub-question is a necessary condition for obtaining the answer to the parent question. Note that if question A and question B are highly related, but obtaining the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, then question A is not a Sub-question of question B. For example, question A "What is the city of Incheon?" and question B "What is the symbol of Incheon?" are very related, but the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, so question A is not a Sub-question of question B.
There are three types of questions, and their definitions are as follows:
One-hop Question: The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
For instance, "Kahibah FC is based is what country?" is a one-hop question since it cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Parallel Multi-hop Question: The question includes multiple independent Sub-questions, so it can be directly broken down into multiple independent Sub-questions.
For instance, "Did LostAlone and Guster have the same number of members?" is a parallel multi-hop question, which can be directly broken down into Sub-question 1 "How many members are in LostAlone?" and Sub-question 2 "How many members are in Guster?".
Sequential Multi-hop Question: The Sub-questions of sequential multi-hop question are dependent. If we want to generate Sub-question 2, we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1.
For instance, "Girard city is located in a county with how many inhabitants?" is a sequential multi-hop question, the Sub-question 1 is "Which county is Girard city located in?". Before obtaining the Sub-questions 2 "How many inhabitants are there in Crawford County?", we must obtain the answer "Crawford County" to the Sub-question 1.
Please identify the type for the given question based on the above definitions and the following examples.

<Example 1>
Question: What is the 2010 census of the city which has Fountain Hill, Pennsylvania as a suburb? 
 Sub-question 1: Which city has Fountain Hill, Pennsylvania as a suburb?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Fountain Hill, Pennsylvania is a borough located in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is a suburb of Allentown, Pennsylvania.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Allentown, Pennsylvania.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What was the population of Allentown, Pennsylvania according to the 2010 census?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.

<Example 2>
Question: What is the birth date of the woman Paul McCartney was engaged to after Linda McCartney's death?
 Sub-question 1: Who was Paul McCartney engaged to after Linda McCartney's death?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Paul McCartney was engaged to Heather Mills after Linda McCartney's death.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Heather Mills.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the birth date of Heather Mills?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 2>
<Example 3>
Question: Are Corylopsis and Impatiens both genus of plants ?
Sub-question 1: What is the genus of Corylopsis?
Sub-question 2: What is the genus of Impatiens?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.

<Example 4>
Question:  When was Jon Amiel born?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.
</Example 4>
<Example 5>
Question: Which author was born first, Lorraine Hansberry or Sandra Gulland?
Sub-question 1: When was Lorraine Hansberry born?
Sub-question 2: When was Sandra Gulland born?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.

<Example 6>
Question: In what year was the college, at which Eric Heenan was educated, founded?
 Sub-question 1: Which college was Eric Heenan educated at?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Eric Heenan is a Canadian actor who was educated at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: University of Victoria.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: In what year was the University of Victoria founded?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.

<Example 7>
Question:  What is the population of Wakeeney?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.

<Example 8>
Question:  When was the documentary film Black Chicks Talking released?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.

<Example 9>
Question: Which rock band was formed earlier, Hinder or The Fatima Mansions?
Sub-question 1: When was Hinder formed?
Sub-question 2: When was The Fatima Mansions formed?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.

The rest Sub-questions: In what year was The Misanthrope first performed?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
