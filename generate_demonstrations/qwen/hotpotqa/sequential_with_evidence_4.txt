Please imitate the following examples to decompose the given question.
Please note that during the decomposition process, you must strictly adhere to the following three guidelines:
Guideline 1: Do not decompose into Sub-questions unrelated to the given question.
Guideline 2: Do not expand the scope of the question.
Guideline 3: Please ensure each Sub-question is self-contained and contextually clear. Avoid using ambiguous references or placeholders that rely on information outside the specific Sub-question.

<Example 1>
Question: Lee Hwan-kyung debuted with a movie written by who?
Sub-question 1: Which movie did Lee Hwan-kyung debut in?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Lee Hwan-kyung is a South Korean actress who made her debut in the 2010 romantic comedy film "A Moment to Remember" (감정의 날).
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: "A Moment to Remember".
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: Who wrote the movie "A Moment to Remember"?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.

<Example 2>
Question: In what year did the co-founder of the RedState group blog launch his english-language online magazine?
Sub-question 1: Which co-founder of the RedState group blog is being referred to?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: RedState is a conservative American political blog founded by Glenn Beck and Erick Erickson.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Glenn Beck or Erick Erickson.
Since the question does not specify which co-founder, we will consider both possibilities. However, for the purpose of decomposition, we will start with Glenn Beck as the primary co-founder.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: In what year did Glenn Beck launch his English-language online magazine?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.

<Example 3>
Question: What is the 2010 census of the city which has Fountain Hill, Pennsylvania as a suburb? 
Sub-question 1: Which city has Fountain Hill, Pennsylvania as a suburb?

Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Allentown, Pennsylvania.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the 2010 census population of Allentown, Pennsylvania?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.

These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
