Definition of Sub-question: A Sub-question is a question that must be answered in the process of finding the answer to its parent question. In other words, obtaining the answer to the Sub-question is a necessary condition for obtaining the answer to the parent question. Note that if question A and question B are highly related, but obtaining the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, then question A is not a Sub-question of question B. For example, question A "What is the city of Incheon?" and question B "What is the symbol of Incheon?" are very related, but the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, so question A is not a Sub-question of question B.
There are three types of questions, and their definitions are as follows:
One-hop Question: The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
For instance, "Kahibah FC is based is what country?" is a one-hop question since it cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Parallel Multi-hop Question: The question includes multiple independent Sub-questions, so it can be directly broken down into multiple independent Sub-questions.
For instance, "Did LostAlone and Guster have the same number of members?" is a parallel multi-hop question, which can be directly broken down into Sub-question 1 "How many members are in LostAlone?" and Sub-question 2 "How many members are in Guster?".
Sequential Multi-hop Question: The Sub-questions of sequential multi-hop question are dependent. If we want to generate Sub-question 2, we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1.
For instance, "Girard city is located in a county with how many inhabitants?" is a sequential multi-hop question, the Sub-question 1 is "Which county is Girard city located in?". Before obtaining the Sub-questions 2 "How many inhabitants are there in Crawford County?", we must obtain the answer "Crawford County" to the Sub-question 1.
Please identify the type for the given question based on the above definitions and the following examples.

<Example 1>
Question: How many lives were lost in the bombing of Nagasaki and Akinoshu Kenji's birthplace?
Sub-question 1: How many lives were lost in the bombing of Nagasaki?
Sub-question 2: What is the birthplace of Akinoshu Kenji?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.
</Example 1>
<Example 2>
Question: Who is the manufacturer of the aircraft with 747 in its name by the Chicago-headquartered company that was once in Seattle?
Sub-question 1: Which Chicago-headquartered company that was once in Seattle manufactures an aircraft with 747 in its name?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: The company that was once in Seattle and is now headquartered in Chicago is Boeing, which manufactures the 747 aircraft.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Boeing.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: Who is the manufacturer of the 747 aircraft?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 2>
<Example 3>
Question: When did the person who said "Child is the father of man" live?
Sub-question 1: Who said "Child is the father of man"?
To obtain the answer to Sub-question 1, we need to identify the person who is attributed with this quote.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: The quote "Child is the father of man" is attributed to William Wordsworth, a prominent English poet.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: William Wordsworth.
The rest Sub-questions: When did William Wordsworth live?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 3>
<Example 4>
Question: What is the population of Luther Burbank's birthplace?
Sub-question 1: Which city is Luther Burbank's birthplace?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Luther Burbank was born in Lancaster, California.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Lancaster.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the population of Lancaster?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 4>
<Example 5>
Question: Who did the artist Kanye profusely apologized to play in The Lorax?
Sub-question 1: Who did Kanye West play in The Lorax?
Sub-question 2: To whom did Kanye West profusely apologize in The Lorax?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.
</Example 5>
<Example 6>
Question: How many lives were lost in the bombing of Nagasaki and the birthplace of Marii Hasegawa?
Sub-question 1: How many lives were lost in the bombing of Nagasaki?
Sub-question 2: What is the birthplace of Marii Hasegawa?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.

<Example 7>
Question:  Where did John Nessel attend school?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.
</Example 7>
<Example 8>
Question:  Which team did Andrew DePaola play for when they won the Super Bowl?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.

<Example 11>
Question: Who did the singer of Wrecking Ball play in Hannah Montana?
Sub-question 1: Who is the singer of the song "Wrecking Ball"?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: The song "Wrecking Ball" was performed by Miley Cyrus.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Miley Cyrus.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: In the TV show Hannah Montana, who did Miley Cyrus play?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 11>
<Example 12>
Question: Who is the player with the most hat tricks between Messi and Ronaldo?
Sub-question 1: How many hat tricks did Messi score?
Sub-question 2: How many hat tricks did Ronaldo score?
