Please note that during the decomposition process, you must strictly adhere to the following three guidelines:
Guideline 1: Do not decompose into Sub-questions unrelated to the given question.
Guideline 2: Do not expand the scope of the question.
Guideline 3: Please ensure each Sub-question is self-contained and contextually clear. Avoid using ambiguous references or placeholders that rely on information outside the specific Sub-question. For example, in Sub-question "What is the composer of the aforementioned movie?", you should replace "the aforementioned movie" with the actual name of the movie it represents.

<Example 1>
Question: Who founded the company known for manufacturing the LINC-8?
Sub-question 1: Which company is known for manufacturing the LINC-8?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: The LINC-8 is a minicomputer developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: Who founded Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
