Definition of Sub-question: A Sub-question is a question that must be answered in the process of finding the answer to its parent question. In other words, obtaining the answer to the Sub-question is a necessary condition for obtaining the answer to the parent question. Note that if question A and question B are highly related, but obtaining the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, then question A is not a Sub-question of question B. For example, question A "What is the city of Incheon?" and question B "What is the symbol of Incheon?" are very related, but the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, so question A is not a Sub-question of question B.
There are three types of questions, and their definitions are as follows:
One-hop Question: The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
For instance, "Kahibah FC is based is what country?" is a one-hop question since it cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Parallel Multi-hop Question: The question includes multiple independent Sub-questions, so it can be directly broken down into multiple independent Sub-questions.
For instance, "Did LostAlone and Guster have the same number of members?" is a parallel multi-hop question, which can be directly broken down into Sub-question 1 "How many members are in LostAlone?" and Sub-question 2 "How many members are in Guster?".
Sequential Multi-hop Question: The Sub-questions of sequential multi-hop question are dependent. If we want to generate Sub-question 2, we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1.
For instance, "Girard city is located in a county with how many inhabitants?" is a sequential multi-hop question, the Sub-question 1 is "Which county is Girard city located in?". Before obtaining the Sub-questions 2 "How many inhabitants are there in Crawford County?", we must obtain the answer "Crawford County" to the Sub-question 1.
Please identify the type for the given question based on the above definitions and the following examples.

<Example 1>
Question: What is the population of the city containing Chu Van An High School?
Sub-question 1: Which city contains Chu Van An High School?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Chu Van An High School is a high school in Hanoi, Vietnam.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Hanoi.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the population of Hanoi?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 1>
<Example 2>
Question:  What is the capital of Cavan county?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.
</Example 2>
<Example 3>
Question: What is the population of Luther Burbank's birthplace?
Sub-question 1: Where was Luther Burbank born?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Luther Burbank was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Lancaster, Massachusetts.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the population of Lancaster, Massachusetts?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 3>
<Example 4>
Question: Which year witnessed the formation of the performer of Rock Show?
Sub-question 1: What is the name of the performer of Rock Show?
Sub-question 2: In which year was the performer of Rock Show formed?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.
</Example 4>
<Example 5>
Question: When is the new album by the performer of Bitches N Marijuana coming out?
Sub-question 1: Who is the performer of Bitches N Marijuana?
Sub-question 2: When is the new album by that performer coming out?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.

<Example 6>
Question: What are the nationality and occupation of the most followed man on Instagram?
Sub-question 1: What is the nationality of the most followed man on Instagram?
Sub-question 2: What is the occupation of the most followed man on Instagram?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.

<Example 7>
Question:  Where is Robert Leonard Hazen born?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.

<Example 8>
Question: How many number 1 hits did performer of Diver Down have?
Sub-question 1: Who is the performer of Diver Down?
Sub-question 2: How many number 1 hits did the performer of Diver Down have?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.

<Example 9>
Question:  Who is the producer of the album Circus Live?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.
</Example 9>
<Example 10>
Question:  Which sports team did Mark Cotney play for when they won the Super Bowl?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.

<Example 11>
Question: Who is the mom of the composer of Face to the Sky?
To decompose the given question, we will follow the guidelines and the examples provided.
Sub-question 1: Who is the composer of Face to the Sky?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Face to the Sky is a song by the British singer-songwriter, James Bay.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: James Bay.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: Who is the mom of James Bay?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 11>
<Example 12>
Question: Who founded the company known for manufacturing the LINC-8?
Sub-question 1: Which company is known for manufacturing the LINC-8?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.

Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: Who founded Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
