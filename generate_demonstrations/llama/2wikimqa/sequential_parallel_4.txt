Definition of Sub-question: A Sub-question is a question that must be answered in the process of finding the answer to its parent question. In other words, obtaining the answer to the Sub-question is a necessary condition for obtaining the answer to the parent question. Note that if question A and question B are highly related, but obtaining the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, then question A is not a Sub-question of question B. For example, question A "What is the city of Incheon?" and question B "What is the symbol of Incheon?" are very related, but the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, so question A is not a Sub-question of question B.
There are three types of questions, and their definitions are as follows:
One-hop Question: The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
For instance, "Kahibah FC is based is what country?" is a one-hop question since it cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Parallel Multi-hop Question: The question includes multiple independent Sub-questions, so it can be directly broken down into multiple independent Sub-questions.
For instance, "Did LostAlone and Guster have the same number of members?" is a parallel multi-hop question, which can be directly broken down into Sub-question 1 "How many members are in LostAlone?" and Sub-question 2 "How many members are in Guster?".
Sequential Multi-hop Question: The Sub-questions of sequential multi-hop question are dependent. If we want to generate Sub-question 2, we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1.
For instance, "Girard city is located in a county with how many inhabitants?" is a sequential multi-hop question, the Sub-question 1 is "Which county is Girard city located in?". Before obtaining the Sub-questions 2 "How many inhabitants are there in Crawford County?", we must obtain the answer "Crawford County" to the Sub-question 1.
Please identify the type for the given question based on the above definitions and the following examples.

<Example 1>
Question:  In which country is Ameixial located?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.
</Example 1>
<Example 2>
Question: What is the date of death of the director of film Don'T Make Waves?
Sub-question 1: Who is the director of the film "Don't Make Waves"?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: The film "Don't Make Waves" is a 1967 American drama film directed by Alexander Mackendrick.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Alexander Mackendrick.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the date of death of Alexander Mackendrick?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 2>
<Example 3>
Question:  Who is the director of the film Brigadoon?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.
</Example 3>
<Example 4>
Question:  Where was Charles Liedtke born?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.
</Example 4>
<Example 5>
Question: Which film came out first, Bad Lieutenant or The Journalist?
Sub-question 1: When was the film Bad Lieutenant released?
Sub-question 2: When was the film The Journalist released?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.
</Example 5>
<Example 6>
Question: Where was the place of death of the director of film The Allure Of Danger?
Sub-question 1: Who is the director of the film "The Allure Of Danger"?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: The Allure of Danger is a 1925 American silent drama film directed by Lambert Hillyer.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Lambert Hillyer.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: Where was the place of death of Lambert Hillyer?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 6>
<Example 7>
Question: What is the date of death of Archduchess Eleanor Of Austria's father?
Sub-question 1: Who is Archduchess Eleanor Of Austria's father?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Archduchess Eleanor of Austria was the daughter of Archduke Charles II of Austria.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Archduke Charles II of Austria.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the date of death of Archduke Charles II of Austria?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 7>
<Example 8>
Question: Were both Dennis Schulp and Benito Masilevu, born in the same place?
Sub-question 1: Where was Dennis Schulp born?
Sub-question 2: Where was Benito Masilevu born?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.
</Example 8>
<Example 9>
Question: What is the place of birth of the director of film Out Of The Drifts?
Sub-question 1: Who is the director of the film "Out Of The Drifts"?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: The information about the director of the film "Out Of The Drifts" is needed to answer this Sub-question.
However, I couldn't find any information about the film "Out Of The Drifts". If you provide more context or information about the film, I can try to find the director and proceed with the decomposition.
Assuming the film "Out Of The Drifts" is a real film, let's continue with the decomposition.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: The director of the film "Out Of The Drifts".
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: Where is the director of the film "Out Of The Drifts" born?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 9>
<Example 10>
Question: Are Steven Wood and Jérôme Carcopino both from the same country?
Sub-question 1: What country is Steven Wood from?
Sub-question 2: What country is Jérôme Carcopino from?
These Sub-questions are independent.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.

<Example 11>
Question:  When was the film Matula released?
The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a one-hop question.
