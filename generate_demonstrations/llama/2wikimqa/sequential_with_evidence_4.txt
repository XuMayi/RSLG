Please imitate the following examples to decompose the given question.
Please note that during the decomposition process, you must strictly adhere to the following three guidelines:
Guideline 1: Do not decompose into Sub-questions unrelated to the given question.
Guideline 2: Do not expand the scope of the question.
Guideline 3: Please ensure each Sub-question is self-contained and contextually clear. Avoid using ambiguous references or placeholders that rely on information outside the specific Sub-question. For example, in Sub-question "What is the composer of the aforementioned movie?", you should replace "the aforementioned movie" with the actual name of the movie it represents.

<Example 1>
Question: Where was the place of death of the director of film The Allure Of Danger?
Sub-question 1: Who is the director of the film "The Allure Of Danger"?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: The Allure of Danger is a 1925 American silent drama film directed by Lambert Hillyer.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Lambert Hillyer.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: Where was the place of death of Lambert Hillyer?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.

<Example 2>
Question: What is the place of birth of the director of film Out Of The Drifts?
Sub-question 1: Who is the director of the film "Out Of The Drifts"?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: The information about the director of the film "Out Of The Drifts" is needed to answer this Sub-question.
However, I couldn't find any information about the film "Out Of The Drifts". If you provide more context or information about the film, I can try to find the director and proceed with the decomposition.
Assuming the film "Out Of The Drifts" is a real film, let's continue with the decomposition.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: The director of the film "Out Of The Drifts".
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: Where is the director of the film "Out Of The Drifts" born?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.

<Example 3>
Question: What is the date of death of Archduchess Eleanor Of Austria's father?
Sub-question 1: Who is Archduchess Eleanor Of Austria's father?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Archduchess Eleanor of Austria was the daughter of Archduke Charles II of Austria.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Archduke Charles II of Austria.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the date of death of Archduke Charles II of Austria?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.

<Example 4>
Question: What is the date of death of the director of film Don'T Make Waves?
Sub-question 1: Who is the director of the film "Don't Make Waves"?
To obtain the rest Sub-questions, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: The film "Don't Make Waves" is a 1967 American drama film directed by Alexander Mackendrick.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Alexander Mackendrick.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the rest Sub-questions as follows:
The rest Sub-questions: What is the date of death of Alexander Mackendrick?
These Sub-questions are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the rest Sub-questions.
Furthermore, answering these Sub-questions is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
