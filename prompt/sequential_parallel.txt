Definition of Sub-question: A Sub-question is a question that must be answered in the process of finding the answer to its parent question. In other words, obtaining the answer to the Sub-question is a necessary condition for obtaining the answer to the parent question. Note that if question A and question B are highly related, but obtaining the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, then question A is not a Sub-question of question B. For example, question A "What is the city of Incheon?" and question B "What is the symbol of Incheon?" are very related, but the answer to question A is not necessary for obtaining the answer to question B, so question A is not a Sub-question of question B.
There are three types of questions, and their definitions are as follows:
One-hop Question: The question is already a minimal question unit and cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
For instance, "Kahibah FC is based is what country?" is a one-hop question since it cannot be broken down into multiple smaller Sub-questions.
Parallel Multi-hop Question: The question includes multiple independent Sub-questions, so it can be directly broken down into multiple independent Sub-questions.
For instance, "Did LostAlone and Guster have the same number of members?" is a parallel multi-hop question, which can be directly broken down into Sub-question 1 "How many members are in LostAlone?" and Sub-question 2 "How many members are in Guster?".
Sequential Multi-hop Question: The Sub-questions of sequential multi-hop question are dependent. If we want to generate Sub-question 2, we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1.
For instance, "Girard city is located in a county with how many inhabitants?" is a sequential multi-hop question, the Sub-question 1 is "Which county is Girard city located in?". Before obtaining the Sub-questions 2 "How many inhabitants are there in Crawford County?", we must obtain the answer "Crawford County" to the Sub-question 1.
Please identify the type for the given question based on the above definitions and the following examples.

<Example 1>
Question: Did LostAlone and Guster have the same number of members?
Sub-question 1: How many members are in LostAlone?
Sub-question 2: How many members are in Guster?
The Sub-questions 1 and 2 are independent.
Furthermore, answering Sub-questions 1 and 2 is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.

<Example 2>
Question: The Dutch-Belgian television series that \"House of Anubis\" was based on first aired in what year?
Sub-question 1: Which Dutch-Belgian television series is based on the House of Anubis？
To obtain the Sub-question 2, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: House of Anubis is a mystery television series developed for Nickelodeon based on the Dutch-Belgian television series "Het Huis Anubis".
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Het Huis Anubis.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the Sub-question 2 as follows:
Sub-question 2: What year did Het Huis Anubis first aired?
The Sub-questions 1 and 2 are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the Sub-question 2.
Furthermore, answering Sub-questions 1 and 2 is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.

<Example 7>
Question: Girard city is located in a county with how many inhabitants?
Sub-question 1: Which county is Girard city located in?
To obtain the Sub-question 2, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Girard is a city in and the county seat of Crawford County, Kansas, United States.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Crawford County.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the Sub-question 2 as follows:
Sub-question 2: How many inhabitants are there in Crawford County?
The Sub-question 1 and 2 are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the Sub-question 2.
Furthermore, answering Sub-questions 1 and 2 is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
</Example 7>
<Example 8>
Question: Harper's Mansion is located in a village that is located along what highway?
Sub-question 1: Which village is Harper's Mansion located in?
To obtain the Sub-question 2, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: Harper’s Mansion is a historic homestead in Berrima, New South Wales.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer to Sub-question 1: Berrima village.
Based on the answer to Sub-question 1, we can further generate the Sub-question 2 as follows:
Sub-question 2: Which highway is Berrima village located along?
The Sub-question 1 and 2 are dependent since we must first obtain the answer to Sub-question 1 before generating the Sub-question 2.
Furthermore, answering Sub-questions 1 and 2 is necessary for obtaining the final answer to the parent question.
Hence, this question is a sequential multi-hop question.
