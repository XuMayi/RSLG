<Example 1>
Text: To classify the given question, let's break it down into sub-questions:
Sub-question 1: What is the majority religion of the area that became India?
Sub-question 2: When was the country origin of Mizraab created in the Arabic dictionary?
Sub-question 3: What is the meaning of the word that is the answer to Sub-question 1?
To further decompose the question, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: The majority religion of the area that became India is Hinduism.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer of Sub-question 1: Hinduism.
Based on the Answer of Sub-question 1, we can further generate the sub-question 2 as follows:
Sub-question 2: When was the country origin of Mizraab created in the Arabic dictionary?
To further decompose this question, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 2.
Evidence of Sub-question 2: The country origin of Mizraab is not found in the Arabic dictionary.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer of Sub-question 2: Not found.
Based on the Answer of Sub-question 2, we can further generate the sub-question 3 as follows:
Sub-question 3: What is the meaning of the word Hinduism?
Hence, this question is a Sequential Multi-hop question.
Output: ['Question 1: What is the majority religion of the area that became India?', 'Question 2: When was the country origin of Mizraab created in the Arabic dictionary?', 'Question 3: What is the meaning of the word Hinduism?']

<Example 2>
Text: Let's generate sub-question 1 first.
Let's analyze the question.
Sub-question 1: What trilogies are being referred to, the prequel and sequel ones?
To determine this, we need additional information, so the question cannot be immediately broken down.
Sub-question 2 (after first determining the answer of Sub-question 1): What were box office values of the Star Wars films in the prequel and/or sequel trilogy?
Now, assuming we've figured out what are the two
trilogies, we can, for example,
Sub-question 3: What was the box office value of the Star Wars films in the prequel trilogy?
Sub-question 4: What was the box office value of the Star Wars films in the sequel trilogy?
We have two parallel paths of questions, so it's a parallel multi-hop question.
Output: ['Question 1: What trilogies are being referred to, the prequel and sequel ones?', 'Question 2: What were box office values of the Star Wars films in the prequel and/or sequel trilogy?', 'Question 3: What was the box office value of the Star Wars films in the prequel trilogy?', 'Question 4: What was the box office value of the Star Wars films in the sequel trilogy?']

Text: To classify the given question, let's break it down into sub-questions.
Sub-question 1: What are the first five picks in the 1998 MLB draft?
To further decompose this question, we must first find the evidence and the answer of the Sub-question 1.
Evidence of Sub-question 1: The first five picks in the 1998 MLB draft were Paul Wilson, Phil Nevin, Pat Burrell, Scott Williamson, and Corey Patterson.
Based on the evidence, we can obtain the answer of Sub-question 1: Paul Wilson, Phil Nevin, Pat Burrell, Scott Williamson, and Corey Patterson.
Based on the Answer of Sub-question 1, we can further generate the sub-question 2 as follows:
Sub-question 2: What is the batting hand of Paul Wilson?
Sub-question 3: What is the batting hand of Phil Nevin?
Sub-question 4: What is the batting hand of Pat Burrell?
Sub-question 5: What is the batting hand of Scott Williamson?
Sub-question 6: What is the batting hand of Corey Patterson?
These sub-questions are independent of each other, and the answer to Sub-question 1 is not needed to obtain the answers to the other sub-questions.
Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.
Output: ['Question 1: What are the first five picks in the 1998 MLB draft?', 'Question 2: What is the batting hand of Paul Wilson?', 'Question 3: What is the batting hand of Phil Nevin?', 'Question 4: What is the batting hand of Pat Burrell?', 'Question 5: What is the batting hand of Scott Williamson?', 'Question 6: What is the batting hand of Corey Patterson?']

<Example 4>
Text: Sub-question 1: What is the dimension of each out of Jaguar I-Pace, Kia Telluride, Volkswagen ID.4, Hyundai Ioniq 5, and Kia EV9?
To further decompose this question, we can generate sub-questions as follows:
Sub-question 2: What is the dimension of the Jaguar I-Pace?
Sub-question 3: What is the dimension of the Kia Telluride?
Sub-question 4: What is the dimension of the Volkswagen ID.4?
Sub-question 5: What is the dimension of the Hyundai Ioniq 5?
Sub-question 6: What is the dimension of the Kia EV9?
The question can be directly decomposed into independent sub-questions (sub-question 2 to sub-question 6). Hence, this question is a parallel multi-hop question.
Output: ['Question 1: What is the dimension of each out of Jaguar I-Pace, Kia Telluride, Volkswagen ID.4, Hyundai Ioniq 5, and Kia EV9?', 'Question 2: What is the dimension of the Jaguar I-Pace?', 'Question 3: What is the dimension of the Kia Telluride?', 'Question 4: What is the dimension of the Volkswagen ID.4?', 'Question 5: What is the dimension of the Hyundai Ioniq 5?', 'Question 6: What is the dimension of the Kia EV9?']
